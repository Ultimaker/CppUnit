See the file INSTALL for basic instructions.  A short explanation for
each non-standard configure option follows.

  --disable-typeinfo-name 

Some output from the library will use a class name to distinguish
between tests.  Normally, the Run-Time Type Information (RTTI) system
is used (specifically, the type_info::name() function) to generate the
name.  Some compilers return human-readable names via this interface.
Other compilers do not.

If your compiler does not generate a pleasing class name, specify
this option; the names will be generated by other means.  The names
are used only for diagnostic purposes -- no functionality will be
lost nor gained by using this option.



		System Notes
		------------

IRIX 6 / MIPSpro compiler
-------------------------

The MIPSpro compiler requires the "-LANG:std" flag to enable the
standard C++ library.  You must set the CC variable when you configure,
as follows
	./configure CC='CC -LANG:std'

There is a bug in released versions of libtool prevents the -LANG flag
from being properly passed during the linking stage.  To check if you
have this bug, examine the output of "grep 'no.*irix' libtool".  If
you see a line like "no/*-*-irix*)" then you suffer from the bug.  [A
fixed version of libtool will look like "no/*-*-irix* | /*-*-irix*)".]

If your libtool script suffers from the bug, open it in an editor,
find the first line that contains "with_gcc", and change it to
read "with_gcc=no".

The MIPSpro version 7.30 is able to compile cppunit proper, but will
fail to compile the example testsuite.  I am assuming this is due
to known bugs in the compiler (7.30 is not the latest version). 
The library appears to function OK.  Please let us know if you find
it otherwise.


DEC alpha with cxx V6.1-029 and RougeWave STL
---------------------------------------------

A user report that you may have to configure using

	./configure DEC_CXX="-D__USE_STD_IOSTREAM -D__STD_MS"

[Is that really "RogueWave"?]

If the compiler complains about 'exception', it may help to
re-run configure with

	CPPFLAGS='-U_OSF_SOURCE'

on the configure line.  Please let us know about your experiences
with this platform so that we can keep this information up-to-date.
