2001-05-19 Baptiste Lepilleur <gaiacrtn@free.fr>

	* Added some items to the TODO list for VC++ TestRunner.
  
	* "Debug" configuration is now the default configuration in VC++
	project.
  
	* Modified sort order in the test browser of VC++ TestRunner so
	that tests are in the same order as in the suite. Suites are still
	sorted alphabetically.
  
	* Merged Steve M. Robbins patch to replace assertImplementation
	with assert in hierarchy example.
  
	* Added a TextTestRunner to runner tests. It is based on Michael
	Feather's version, but have been rewriten.

	while running.

	TextTestResult.
  
	* Updated hierarchy example to use TextTestRunner.

2001-05-18 Baptiste Lepilleur <gaiacrtn@free.fr>

	* Symbol CU_USE_TYPEINFO must be defined instead of USE_TYPEINFO
	to compile RTTI.
  
	* Added back default constructor to TestSuiteBuilder which use
	RTTI.  It is available only if CU_USE_TYPEINFO is defined.
  
	* Moved TypeInfoHelper.h from src/cppunit to
	include/cppunit/extensions.
  
	* Macro CU_TEST_SUITE in HelperMacros.h now use TestSuiteBuilder
	default constructor if CU_USE_TYPEINFO is defined, otherwise it
	use the type name given to the CU_TEST_SUITE macro.
  
	* TestFactoryRegistry::registerFactory(factory) now generate a
	dummy name based on a serial number instead of using RTTI. The
	macro CU_TEST_SUITE_REGISTRATION and class AutoRegisterSuite can
	now when CU_USE_TYPEINFO is not defined.
  
	* Added a new Configuration named "Debug Without CU_USE_TYPEINFO"
	to msvc6 projects. The flag CU_USE_TYPEINFO is not defined in that
	configuration.

2001-05-17  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Makefile.am (dist-hook): Copy files relative to $(top_srcdir).

	* doc/Makefile.am: Generated doc files depend on Doxyfile.

	* doc/Doxyfile.in: Use autoconf substitutions in file names.

	* examples/hierarchy/Makefile.am (check_PROGRAMS): Build hierarchy
          with "make check", not "make all".

	* examples/hierarchy/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): 

	* src/cppunit/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Search in 
	  $(top_srcdir)/include.

	existing TestCases.
	
2001-04-29 Bastiaan Bakker <bastiaan.bakker@lifeline.nl>

	* Merged Baptiste Lepilleurs CppUnitW 1.2. Some differences:
	TypeInfo stuff (in TestSuite) compiled in only if USE_TYPEINFO is
	set.  TestSuite.getTests now returns a const ref instead of taking
	a ref as parameter.  Removed auto_ptr stuff from
	TestFactoryRegistry: auto_ptr cannot be used in containers.
	
2001-04-28 Bastiaan Bakker <bastiaan.bakker@lifeline.nl>

	* Moved autoconf auxiliary stuff into new subdir config, to make
	the top dir less crowded.

	* Prefixed std:: to cerr, cout and endl.

	cppunit/TestSuite.cpp: applied patch #402271 by bwithrow.  Fixes
	bug #220207

	contents have been deleted (so there are no invalid pointers in
	the vector) Patch #403540 / #403542
	
	* cppunit/TestCaller.h: create Fixture with empty constructor so
	that only the TestCaller but not the Fixture instance is
	registered in the TestRegistry Patch #403541 / #403542

	* examples/hierarchy/BoardGameTest.h,
	examples/hierarchy/ChessTest.h, examples/hierarchy/main.cpp:
	initialize example TestCases with TestSuite so that the
	TestCallers are registered in the TestRegistry Patch
	#403542. Fixes bug #415249
 
	* cppunit/TestCaller.h, cppunit/TestCase.cpp, cppunit/TestCase.h:
	changed documentation; made hopefully clearer which constructor
	registers the instance in the TestRegistry; corrected syntax in
