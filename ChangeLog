2001-05-20 Baptiste Lepilleur <gaiacrtn@free.fr>
  * Fixed bug #424320 (VC++ TestRunner): access violation caused by NULL pointer in history list. NULL pointer are not added to the history anymore.

2001-05-19 Baptiste Lepilleur <gaiacrtn@free.fr>
  * Added some items to the TODO list for VC++ TestRunner.
  * "Debug" configuration is now the default configuration in VC++ project.
  * Modified sort order in the test browser of VC++ TestRunner so that tests are in the same order as in the suite. Suites
    are still sorted alphabetically.
  * Merged Steve M. Robbins patch to replace assertImplementation with assert in hierarchy example.
  * Added a TextTestRunner to runner tests. It is based on Michael Feather's version, but have been rewriten.
  * Removed traces that printed the test name in TextTestResult while running.
  * Added the test name to error and failure report in TextTestResult.
  * Updated hierarchy example to use TextTestRunner.

2001-05-18 Baptiste Lepilleur <gaiacrtn@free.fr>
  * Symbol CU_USE_TYPEINFO must be defined instead of USE_TYPEINFO to
    compile RTTI.
  * Added back default constructor to TestSuiteBuilder which use RTTI.
    It is available only if CU_USE_TYPEINFO is defined.
  * Moved TypeInfoHelper.h from src/cppunit to include/cppunit/extensions.
  * Macro CU_TEST_SUITE in HelperMacros.h now use TestSuiteBuilder default
    constructor if CU_USE_TYPEINFO is defined, otherwise it use the
    type name given to the CU_TEST_SUITE macro.
  * TestFactoryRegistry::registerFactory(factory) now generate a dummy
    name based on a serial number instead of using RTTI. The macro
    CU_TEST_SUITE_REGISTRATION and class AutoRegisterSuite can now
    when CU_USE_TYPEINFO is not defined.
  * Added a new Configuration named "Debug Without CU_USE_TYPEINFO" to 
    msvc6 projects. The flag CU_USE_TYPEINFO is not defined in that 
    configuration.

2001-05-17  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>
	* Makefile.am (dist-hook): Copy files relative to $(top_srcdir).
	* doc/Makefile.am: Generated doc files depend on Doxyfile.
	* doc/Doxyfile.in: Use autoconf substitutions in file names.
	* examples/hierarchy/Makefile.am (check_PROGRAMS): Build hierarchy
          with "make check", not "make all".
	* examples/hierarchy/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): 
	* src/cppunit/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Search in 
	  $(top_srcdir)/include.
	* Added .cvsignore files.

2001-05-16 Bastiaan Bakker <bastiaan.bakker@lifeline.nl>

	  TestCases.
	
2001-04-29 Bastiaan Bakker <bastiaan.bakker@lifeline.nl>
	* Merged Baptiste Lepilleurs CppUnitW 1.2. Some differences:

	  is set. 
	  TestSuite.getTests now returns a const ref instead of taking a 
	  ref as parameter.

	  auto_ptr cannot be used in containers.

2001-04-15 Bastiaan Bakker <bastiaan.bakker@lifeline.nl>

	  This should make more clear which headers are used internally only
	  (like estring.h).
	
	* Moved autoconf auxiliary stuff into new subdir config, to make the
	  top dir less crowded.

	* Prefixed std:: to cerr, cout and endl.

	  have been deleted (so there are no invalid pointers in the vector)
	  Patch #403540 / #403542
	
	* cppunit/TestCaller.h: create Fixture with empty constructor so that 
	  only the TestCaller but not the Fixture instance is registered in

	  Patch #403541 / #403542

	* examples/hierarchy/BoardGameTest.h, examples/hierarchy/ChessTest.h,
